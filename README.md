# School_District_Analysis

# Overview

The analysis was to find high school students standardized Math and Reading scores in the district for funding purposes. Once the analysis was completed someone notified Maria and her staff that  Thomas High School  9th grade Reading and Math scores may have been incorrect due to academic dishonesty(cheating). Maria and her staff got back to work to recalculate the results of her analysis without including the Thomas High School scores.
